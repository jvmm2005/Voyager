# Welocome to Voyager´s README
## Introduction
This is a project where we are going to learn about the position of the Voyagers, these, are two vessels launched in 1977 and we are going to calculate the space that they will travel is a long period of time.
## Execution
-You have to download the Voyager.py program and execute it in visual studio code with python (Introducing directory and name code).

-Once executed you will have to make two inputs, one for the first experiment and the other one for the second one. 

-In the first one you will inroduce days and in the second one years.
## Description
In the code we have an introduction at the begining of both experiments where is given some hitoric context.
Then we have the creation of some variables and constants like Velocity and time.
We also have the creation of a function, used to calculate the space travelled multiple times.
There are other operations like a change of units for the days and the years
And finaly to be more precise we make a final change of units to the year/light.
## Examples
For:
Day time = 30.
Year time = 3.
Ball in 30 days travel 518.400 km and in a year 630.720.000 km.
Voyager 1 in 3 years 43.919.998,848 km and 0.004642313424657534 Light/year.
Voyager 2 in 3 years 41.680.801.152 km and 0.004405631780821918 Light/year.

## FAQ
Common errors:
-Use only numbers, no letters of units.
-Dont leave the space empty.
-Wrong name file. Be shure you are putting the correct code to initializate.
